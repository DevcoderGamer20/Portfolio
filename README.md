# Portfolio
My Experience:
Building this portfolio using only HTML and Tailwind CSS was a valuable experience. I learned how to create responsive layouts using Tailwindâ€™s utility-first classes. It helped me improve my understanding of semantic HTML and UI/UX best practices. The project also gave me hands-on practice with structuring a webpage into reusable sections and working with forms, grid layouts, and transitions.
